        "The Kingdom of Elea lies far to the east of the Eastern Archipelago, therefore its contacts with the Kingdom of Myrtana have been very limited. It was founded centuries ago by the ancient Builders, whose influences were also present in Jharkendar. The Kingdom was not endangered by the war with Orcs, but it does not mean it was a peaceful land. Approximately 500 years ago, on the Eleian land, appeared a woman named Hatiret, who declared herself a goddess. The dispute regarding her true nature still holds, however it can't be denied that she had enormous magic power and the charisma of a true-born leader. All that allowed her to amass numerous bands of opportunists, leading to the formation of an army with which Hatiret tried to overthrow the king and take the throne for herself. In the end, her troops lost, and the king's men forced her army to retreat. They took shelter on an isolated island, Samoa, where she ordered the raising of a city and started the cult of Hasisians, being its center of worship. Soon after that, she mysteriously disappeared. Despite that, her cult was developing rapidly. The Hasisians have designed and built very swift ships called drakkars. Using them, during the next centuries they had sown terror in the Eleian hearts, capturing their ships and sacrificing enslaved sailors to Hatiret.",
        'Ultimately, about 100 years ago, King Sireus V of Elea led an assault on Samoa, completely crushing Hasisian defences and wiping out almost every one of them. The island fell into the Eleian hands, however some descendants of the last surviving Hatiret followers can still be found. During the fighting, desperate Hasisians have cast a curse on the city of Hasis, killing every living creature inside the walls. As a result of these events, their secrets and treasures remain unfound up to this day...',
        'Today, the Kingdom of Elea is ridden by chaos. The power struggles between the royalists, water mages, and noblemen had weakened the country significantly. Soon after then, the pirates under the command of Hannibal had decided to seize their opportunity and invaded the Kingdom.',
