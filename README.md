Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Start by enabling Corepack (built-in Node.js tool), if it isn't already; this will add (or override) the `yarn` binary to your `PATH`:

```bash
corepack enable
```

> [Read more about Corepack here.](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html)

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn preview
```
